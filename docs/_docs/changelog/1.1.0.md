* Updated the Android Estimote SDK version to 1.0.3.
* Updated the iOS Estimote SDK to version 4.26.3.
* Overhaul of the EstimoteUnity inspector UI. Now much easier to use.
* Added in support for multiple beacon regions (UUID’s). You can now use the new inspector UI to add beacon regions.
* Added in a button to add the default Estimote UUID to the list of beacon regions, if it has not been added already.
* Removed all logging within the native plugins and within the Unity C# scripts. Users can now add in logging themselves if they wish to.
* Updated the demo scene to support multiple beacon regions. Also added in a basic showcase for caching beacons and removing them from a list when they have not been seen for ‘x’ seconds.
* Fixed an issue when grabbing the accuracy value, sometimes it would throw an invalid cast exception.
* Made EstimoteUnityBeacon implement IEquatable so you can now do comparisons.
