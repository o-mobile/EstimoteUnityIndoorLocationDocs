* Added Estimote Cloud SDK support. You can now enable this in the EstimoteUnity inspector and request extra information about a Estimote Beacon using the GetBeaconCloudDetails() method.
* Added in more callbacks from the native plugin.
* All events are now UnityEvents and can be found under the “Events” section in the EstimoteUnity inspector.
* The demo scene has been overhauled. It now lists all beacons that have been found and selecting one will attempt to grab the cloud information for that beacon and display it.
* Updated the EstimoteUnity class so that it's now a partial class and EstimoteUnityAndroid and EstimoteUnityIOS are a part of that partial class.
