An example scene has been provided under the EstimoteUnityIndoorLocation/Examples/Scenes folder. It has been designed to be deployed straight away to your device (as long as you have performed the SDK setup described in the quick start guide). You will need to input your Estimote cloud details within the inspector and then define the "location" you want to test within the demo controller inspector.

The demo scene will show you how you can retrieve a location from the Estimote cloud service, draw that location within Unity and then start positioning to locate you within that location.
