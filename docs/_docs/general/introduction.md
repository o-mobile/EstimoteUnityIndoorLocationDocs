The Estimote Unity Indoor Location plugin allows you to use the Indoor Location SDK from Estimote within Unity and deploy to iOS or Android. It gives you positional information within a location that has been setup using the Indoor Location SDK.

We advise you read up on the Indoor Location SDK and its features before diving into this plugin to ensure you understand how everything works. You can find the documentation from Estimote [here](http://developer.estimote.com/indoor/map-your-location/) and you can purchase their beacons [here](https://estimote.com/products/).
