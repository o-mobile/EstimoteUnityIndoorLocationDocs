The Estimote Unity plugin allows you to use the Estimote SDK within Unity and deploy to iOS or Android. Whether you are using Estimote beacons or any other iBeacon manufacturer this plugin will work for you (excluding the cloud based Estimote features).

We do however recommend you use [Estimote beacons](https://estimote.com/) as they are and reliable and very well built.
